# SQLMiniDB

SQLMiniDB is a lightweight SQL database engine implemented in C++. It supports basic SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and TRUNCATE TABLE. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the inner workings of a database engine.

## Features

- SQL Parsing
- Query Optimization
- Query Execution
- Transaction Management
- Basic Indexing (Placeholder)
- Join Reordering (Placeholder)

## Prerequisites

- CMake 3.10 or higher
- A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Setup

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asrayg/SQLMiniDB.git
   cd SQLMiniDB
   ```

2. Create a build directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to generate the build system:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

### Running the Tests

1. Run the tests using CTest:

   ```bash
   ctest
   ```

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the executable and execute SQL commands interactively.

```bash
./SQLMiniDB
```

### Example SQL Commands

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (id, name, position);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Manager');
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'Developer');
SELECT id, name FROM employees WHERE position = 'Developer';
UPDATE employees SET name = 'Charlie' WHERE id = 2;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
DROP TABLE employees;
```

## Code Overview

### SQL Parsing

The SQL parser converts SQL queries into an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation.

### Query Optimization

The query optimizer improves the efficiency of query execution by applying various optimization techniques such as removing unnecessary columns and reordering joins.

### Query Execution

The query executor processes the AST and performs the necessary operations on the database.

### Transaction Management

The transaction manager ensures ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for database transactions.
